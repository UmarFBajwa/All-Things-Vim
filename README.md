## Ye Olde Online Shoppe

### Overview
This is a multi-day, agile development challenge that will require you to create an online store using Rails. You will work in frequent, small iterations.  After each iteration, you will consult with a "senior engineer".  This app will have a polished user interface and be fully tested.

### Requirements
- The role of the "senior engineer" will also be played by one of your dear instructors.  The engineer will consult with you on testing, design decisions, or provide code review.
- Maintain the [Documentation README](./doc/README.md) over the entire course of this project.  The README is the first thing other developers see when looking at your app.
- You will work in pairs and at some point you will switch code bases. (Say it with me: "I am not my code").  When you meet with your new pair, you will discuss which code base to move forward with.  You will need to get your pair up to speed or get up to speed on each new-ish code base.
- Use HAML to construct views and SCSS or SASS for stylesheets.
- Challenge is limited to basic Javascript and jQuery only.  No JS Frameworks.  If you find something you'd like to use and are unsure, consult your "senior engineer".
- The Documentation README will be up to date before every client meeting or code review request.
- The Client doesn't know what localhost is. Each iteration must be deployed for review.

The iterations are provided below. As you complete them, you will meet with your "senior engineer" to receive further instructions from the client.

### First Iteration

- Document initial user stories.
- Whiteboard or prototype a few mockups and page flows and add them to the documentation.
- Whiteboard or design the data and schema you'll need to keep track of for this app to work and add to the documentation. If you use Schema Designer it's a good idea to paste the generated XML into a separate file in addition to adding a screenshot in the README.
- Add functionality for managing products to the included Rails application skeleton.  It'll be helpful to have a baseline where the client can enter products into the system, manage the products, and view them.
- We will not need any authentication mechanism.
- Include basic styles for the website and image placeholders for the products.
- Have RSpec model, controller, and feature tests.

Move through the the items above __as quickly__ as you can, without much attachment. These are just a starting point.  As we gather feedback and learn more about what it takes to develop the app, we want to be able to change these easily.  'Cause that's Agile and that's how we do it.

Happy Hacking, now GO Build! <3
